# 🧠 Dunning-Kruger ABM Simulation: Fake News Diffusion via Bayesian Update

This repository contains an **Agent-Based Model (ABM)** that simulates the spread of fake news in a social network, integrating the **Dunning-Kruger effect** and **Bayesian belief updating**. The model demonstrates how overconfident, low-knowledge agents can accelerate misinformation diffusion—and how rational updates may or may not mitigate the effect.

## 📌 Project Highlights

- 🧠 Agents are initialized with different **knowledge** and **confidence** levels.
- 🌐 Agents are embedded in a **Watts-Strogatz small-world network**.
- 🔁 Beliefs about fake news are updated using **Bayesian inference**.
- 📉 Tracks the **proportion of believers** over simulation steps.
- 📊 Includes visual outputs: network diffusion graph and belief curve.
